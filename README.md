## Testing

This app was tested using [HTML](https://validator.w3.org/) validator, [HTML-Accessibility](https://achecker.ca/checker/index.php) validator and [chrome accessibility tools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/accessibility-developer-t/fpkknkljclfencbdbgkenhalefipecmb?hl=en).

### Notes

I ignore the google chrome accessibility tools audit warnings of text-elements contrast and focusability, because the elements that being warned is the element that I intentionally hidden (transparent anchor text-element). Thus, it will not affect anybody that use it.
